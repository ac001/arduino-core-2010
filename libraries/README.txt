The packages included here are at the moment:
* directly copied from arduino-0017/
* downloaded from arduino website and other sources
* extracted into directories and ready to go.

At the moment this is for demonstration.

But it will be heaven for an end user, instead of having to go off and downlaod, unzip etc..

Only snag is somehow 
* Versioning
* linking the documentationa and website.... and credits etc


To be clever, a set of script could be setup to "pull" this stuff
from recognised places eg
svn co http://xyz.com/m-Lib/trunk ./m-Lib


To make this extensive we will need to 
1) create and "externals" scripts or the like..
2) have libs pushed here
3) documentation and api changes



ummm ;-)
